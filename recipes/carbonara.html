        </li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A lotta salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Prep">Prep:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate/Shred the cheese into the bowl.
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure it's finely ground.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cut the bacon into small pieces.
            <ul>
                <li>Think bite sized (bigger than bacon bits).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Lay the individual bacon bites into a cold skillet to prepare for cooking.
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure they're as evenly spread out as possible.</li>
                <li>I also like to try to place all the fattiest pieces first/at the bottom so it can render off first and help cook the rest of the bacon.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cooking:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the skillet with the bacon on the stove and turn the heat to medium to start.
        <p><strong>NOTE: Since each stovetop is different, I consider medium to be the point at which if you dropped in a single piece of bacon it would smoke a bit too much. I know that's not that specific, but that's the best I got ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure the bacon starts out cooking in the cold pan you <a href="#Prep">prepared earlier</a>.</li>
                <li>Since the pan has to heat up & there's so much bacon, you can focus & move onto step 2 & 3 for the next couple of minutes.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check back every couple of minutes & stir around the bacon until it's all a little bit cooked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once the bacon has gotten some color & most of the fat has rendered off, reduce the heat to medium low.</li>
                <li>Stir the bacon around once every minute or so until cooked.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want greater temperature control at this point, feel free to turn your stovetop down to as low as you want.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once the bacon is cooked to a point where there's equal parts crunch & chew, turn off the heat, move the skillet off the burner, & transfer the bacon bites onto a rack/paper towel lined plate to remove the grease.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>While the bacon is cooking, crack the eggs into the bowl with the cheese.
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure to separate the egg yolks from the whites.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'd recommend starting out with 8 yolks & 1 full egg, then add an extra whole egg after combining all the ingredients if the sauce seems too solid.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once all the eggs are cracked, whisk the eggs & cheese together until it's a smooth mixture.</li>
                <li>Next, mince & <em>very finely</em> slice the garlic & add it to the mixture (if you want).
                    <ul>
                        <li>While garlic isn't traditionally in Carbonara, a hint of it is amazing in this dish!</li>
                        <li>I've found that 2 cloves can be too underwhelming, while 3 cloves can make the dish a wee bit too garlicy, so 2 1/2 cloves has been my sweet spot.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once the mixture is smooth, add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper to the mixture & whisk again.</li>
                <li>Then add a good sized pinch of salt & mix it into the mixture.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start off with a bit less salt than you think you need, since this is quite a salty dish already, & keep adding more to taste.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As stated above <strong>TASTE THE SAUCE FOR MORE SEASONING!!!</strong> The sauce is what makes the carbonara, so give it the attention to detail it deserves.</li>
                <li><ins>Complete step 1 before going any further.</ins></li>
                <li>Once the bacon is done cooking, slowly incorporate as much of the bacon fat into the sauce as you desire, while quickly whisking it in.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure to add the bacon fat in slowly, since you don't want to cook the eggs.</li>
                        <li>Also, make sure to add the bacon fat in quickly, since you don't want the fat to solidify. You want it to perfectly merge with the sauce.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>While the bacon is starting cooking, add <u>JUST BARELY</u> enough water to a pot to cover all your pasta while cooking.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Once the water is added, add a lot of salt to the pot.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat to high & bring the water to a boil.</li>
                <li><ins>Complete Step 2 before continuing.</ins></li>
            </ol>
        
        <br>

        <li>Once the water is boiling, add the pasta to the pot & cook until al dente.
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure to stir the pasta around every couple of minutes to prevent it from sticking together.</li>
                <li>Also, make sure to taste the pasta every couple of minutes to make sure it's cooked to your liking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>While the pasta is cooking, place your metal bowl with the sauce on top of the pot to create a double boiler.
            <ul>
                <li>Then begin aggressively whisking the sauce while on the double boiler.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This loosens up the sauce and makes it creamier than it normally would be.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You don't need to have the double boiler going the whole time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I like to whisk it over the boiler for 2 minutes at a time, then take it off for 1 minute intervals to check the pasta & make sure the sauce isn't getting overcooked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Also, make sure the bowl isn't touching the water.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>Once the pasta is done, set aside a cup or two of the pasta water.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Then drain the pasta into a strainer and quickly return it to the same pot.</li>
                <li>Add the bacon to the pasta & stir around so it's evenly dispersed</li>
                <li>Then slowly start incorporating your sauce into the pasta
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure to add the sauce in slowly, since you don't want to cook the eggs.</li>
                        <li>Also, make sure to stir the sauce in quickly, as you want it to be spread around as evenly as possible while the heat from the pasta solidifies the sauce a bit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once the sauce is fully incorporated, add a splash of pasta water if the sauce seems too thick.
                    <ul>
                        <li>As with the sauce, quickly mix it around to get it properly incorporated, and only add a little bit at a time as to not water down the sauce any more than necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <br>

        <li>Once the sauce is fully incorporated, serve the pasta into bowls & top with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper & freshly grated parmesan cheese.
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure to serve the pasta immediately, as it's best when it's fresh.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
