# Recipe HTML Website

## Description

This was the first project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). The goal was to create a recipe website using HTML. While it says to create multiple recipes, I only added one for now since I went into a lot of detail with it. I probably won't add any more in the future, since it's pure HTML and I want to move on to CSS and JavaScript.
